# explanation-of-decorator

 Decorators in Python have puzzled me for quite some time, so I decided to dive in and figure out what's really happening when using decorators.   
 This explanation file contains my understanding of how decorators work in Python, focusing on the logic behind their application.  
 In short: it’s all about how functions are treated as objects and what the () symbol means in Python.  
 You can also run the file to see the results for yourself. <br> 

 Since I'm still learning programming, if you notice any mistakes or confusing points, please feel free to let me know!
