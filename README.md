# Explanation of Decorator

 Decorators in Python have puzzled me for quite some time, so I decided to dive in and figure out what's really happening when using decorators.<br>
 
 This explanation file contains my understanding of how decorators work in Python, focusing on the logic behind their application.<br>
 
 In short: itâ€™s all about how functions are treated as objects and what the () symbol means in Python.<br>
 
 You can also run the file to see the results for yourself.<br> 

 Since I'm still learning programming, if you notice any mistakes or confusing points, please feel free to let me know!
